The following are tests for the Aspen HYSYS/ Aspen APEA/HERON integration.
Since this integration typically requires developing cost functions of different components, scripts that produce cost functions are included too.

1- Aspen_HERON_FullTest, 

2- create_APEA_Comps, 

3-create_FORCE_Comps, 

4-create_HYSYS_Comps, 

5-create HYSYS_Comps, 

6-HERON_update_withCompSets


Definitions
- "Force Component": a component whose attributes are imported from two (or more) IES codes
- "Component set": a set of components grouped together to be represented later as one component


The full test is "Aspen_HERON_FullTest". The other tests are intermediate steps.
